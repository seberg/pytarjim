Added sparsevoc into makemaps.pl as well as s tag in arabtex.maps.
Also a change to remove the alif in li-al- for arabic.

Sparse vocalization will work as normal vocalization mode, however remove the
fatha, damma and kassra before the long vowel.

IMPORTANT: Sparse vocalization as is, relies on execution order and multiple
execution within same pass, I do NOT think this works in xetex/teckit itself.
On the other hand maybe not inserting the extra " (Z) but relying on teckit not
to process the result ever maybe works...
